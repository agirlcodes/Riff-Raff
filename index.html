            <h1>Start of Adventure</h1>
            <h3> First steps through our project! </h3>
            <p><i> By Cameron, Game Developer </i></p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    The first week of our development was purely 
                    about meetings and discussing what the game 
                    should actually be. 
                    This involved brainstorming different game 
                    mechanics and different colour themes.
                </li>
                <li>
                    It was very important for the team to establish a 
                    purpose for the game to give meaning to the players 
                    actions. 
                </li>
                <li>
                    The initial idea for the game was for it to be a 
                    puzzle game but this proved itself to be too much 
                    to ask for our target audience as the game is aimed
                    towards people aged 12 and over. 
                </li>
                <li>
                    This is where we decided the game should be an adventure 
                    exploration experience.

            <h3> Second steps to follow! </h3>
            <p><i> By Cameron, Game Developer </i></p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    In the second week the team focused on coming up with prototypes for the games core mechanics. 
                    This included character movement, a collection system and the level objective’s first iteration. 
                    At this point these mechanics were all in separate projects because they were still in the prototype stage.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The player's objective mechanic was designed to challenge the player's observation skills. 
                </li>
                <li>
                    We created gold coins as an item for the collection system. This mechanic was implemented to 
                    offer a secondary objective for the player. It was designed to enhance player guidance in 
                    the form of incentive to collect more coins.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The game’s target age is 12 and over so we wanted the art style to be low poly with colours 
                    relating to nature such as green, blue and brown.

                <h1>Ideas for level design coming!</h1>
                <h3> First thoughts about Level Design. </h3>
                <p><i> By Cameron, Game Developer </i></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Week 3 was devoted to talking about level design and how we can use it to optimize our mechanics. 
                        We came up with 3 iterations of levels in what would ultimately become the 
                        area of exploitation for the player. This was a useful component of the game to 
                        establish early because then mechanics and narrative can be implemented and adjusted 
                        to suit the level design.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The most important goal for the team in terms of level design was for the player to know how 
                        to traverse the level without it becoming too complicated to figure out where things are. 
                    </li>

                    <h3> Good progress! </h3>
                    <p><i> By Zac, Game Developer </i></p>
                    <p> Overall this week was quite a productive one for us game students. </p>
                    <!-- <ul> -->
                        <p>
                            In our group meeting we finalised the narrative that we wanted to go with for 
                            the game which was ‘A rich man has sent you on an adventure to an island to 
                            find the hidden treasure that’s shown on the map you were given.’ 
                            We went with this as it keeps the game lighthearted and keeps in with our target audience of 12+. 
                            We also decided on a name for the game which was ‘Kevin’s Adventure’.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            We also started to get a basic layout of the level made within the project. 
                            Some simple trees, coins and a path were added which started to form the 
                            basic outline of the main route that the player would need to take. 
                            Points of interest in the form of large pink cubes were also added to 
                            assist in showing the player where they need to go. <br>

                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Work has also started with the ‘day/night cycle’ that we want to add to the game 
                            to help add some immersion to the game.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The main task of finding and unlocking the treasure has also begun and it basically 
                            involves the player needing to find certain items hidden within the island and use 
                            them to unlock the door to the main treasure. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Model that we want to use for the main character ‘Kevin’ was decided. 
                            We went for a model that was; low poly, had simple features, was distinguishable 
                            and suited for the adventure type narrative that we are going with. <br>

                        This week we worked on getting a 3d model for our character and started to rig 
                        walking animation for him. We used Inverse kinematics and raycast to do this. 
                        We finished our textures for our terrain. We planned out a final draft for our schedule 
                        after calculating what we had done so far and what we had left to do. <br>

                        The web developers have made good progress. For this week we had the task of finishing the landing page illustration. Despite it not looking like much so 
                        far, I am sure it'll develop into a friendly and bubbly first impression. <br>

                        Also, tasked with designing the games logo, my fello web developer created a truly amazing 
                        template for the game’s logo.  Since we have completed our wireframes in Visual Studio Code, 
                        I feel confident in this projects direction and most importantly meeting the self-given deadline.

                        The most exciting part this week is presenting the completed illustration for the landing page. 
                        Researching illustrations that match our aesthetic, and a long week of learning Adobe illusatrator 
                        commands and shortcuts later,  I present the final product to the group:

                        Update:<br>
                        They liked the landing page! We are one small step away from having a finished product!

                    <h1>One step closer to the finished product</h1>
                    <h3> Final stage of the website! </h3>
                    <p><i> By Jackeline, Web Developer </i></p>
                    <p> The website is in the final stages of development, in this week we focused mainly 
                        on user interactivity – Nataly, my web developer fellow implemented 
                        bubbles for the user to interact because once the user clicks them, they pop! 
                        As our game has a bubble machine, we thought we had to include something 
                        bubble-related to the website and this was the most fun idea we had! 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Altogether with this a new section has been implemented, the blog section where it 
                        will take the user to our itch.io blogsite where they would enjoy three 
                        blogposts about our experiences developing this game and website.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Also, thanks to the feedback that we received last week we decided to implement a comment 
                        box section below the game so users can leave feedback for us. Last but not least, 
                        the developer log books, as we can see now, are implemented on the website with 
                        different perspectives from the game developers and my web developer colleague!
