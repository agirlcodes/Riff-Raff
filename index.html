            <h1> First steps through our project! </h1>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    The first week of our development was purely 
                    about meetings and discussing what the game 
                    should actually be. 
                    This involved brainstorming different game 
                    mechanics and different colour themes.
                </li>
                <li>
                    It was very important for the team to establish a 
                    purpose for the game to give meaning to the players 
                    actions. 
                </li>
                <li>
                    The initial idea for the game was for it to be a 
                    puzzle game but this proved itself to be too much 
                    to ask for our target audience as the game is aimed
                    towards people aged 12 and over. 
                </li>
                <li>
                    This is where we decided the game should be an adventure 
                    exploration experience.
                </li> 
            </ul>

            <h1> Second steps to follow! </h1>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    In the second week the team focused on coming up with prototypes for the games core mechanics. 
                    This included character movement, a collection system and the level objective’s first iteration. 
                    At this point these mechanics were all in separate projects because they were still in the prototype stage.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The player's objective mechanic was designed to challenge the player's observation skills. 
                </li>
                <li>
                    We created gold coins as an item for the collection system. This mechanic was implemented to 
                    offer a secondary objective for the player. It was designed to enhance player guidance in 
                    the form of incentive to collect more coins.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The game’s target age is 12 and over so we wanted the art style to be low poly with colours 
                    relating to nature such as green, blue and brown.

                <h1> First thoughts about Level Design. </h1>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Week 3 was devoted to talking about level design and how we can use it to optimize our mechanics. 
                        We came up with 3 iterations of levels in what would ultimately become the 
                        area of exploitation for the player. This was a useful component of the game to 
                        establish early because then mechanics and narrative can be implemented and adjusted 
                        to suit the level design.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The most important goal for the team in terms of level design was for the player to know how 
                        to traverse the level without it becoming too complicated to figure out where things are. 
                    </li>

                    <h1> Good progress! </h1>
                    <p> Overall this week was quite a productive one for us game students. </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            In our group meeting we finalised the narrative that we wanted to go with for 
                            the game which was ‘A rich man has sent you on an adventure to an island to 
                            find the hidden treasure that’s shown on the map you were given.’ 
                            We went with this as it keeps the game lighthearted and keeps in with our target audience of 12+. 
                            We also decided on a name for the game which was ‘Kevin’s Adventure’.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            We also started to get a basic layout of the level made within the project. 
                            Some simple trees, coins and a path were added which started to form the 
                            basic outline of the main route that the player would need to take. 
                            Points of interest in the form of large pink cubes were also added to 
                            assist in showing the player where they need to go.
                        </li>

                    <p> 
                        This week we worked on getting a 3d model for our character and started to rig 
                        walking animation for him. We used Inverse kinematics and raycast to do this. 
                        We finished our textures for our terrain. We planned out a final draft for our schedule 
                        after calculating what we had done so far and what we had left to do.

                    <p>
                        The web developers have made good progress. For this week the web developers 
                        have the task of finishing the landing page illustration, despite it not looking like much so 
                        far it will develop into a friendly and bubbly first impression. 
                        Also, tasked with designing the games logo, my fello web developer created a truly amazing 
                        template for the game’s logo.  Since we have completed our wireframes in Visual Studio Code, 
                        I feel confident in this projects direction and most importantly meeting the self-given deadline.
